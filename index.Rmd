description: |
 The ECIP (Explicit Causal Inference in Psychology) network is a scientific network aiming to reduce this divergence by demonstrating how personality researchers can effectively integrate causality into their work.

  We will address methodological and conceptual issues surrounding causal personality research developing methodological and conceptual guidelines and tutorials.The network's outcomes will further consist of empirical research projects that explicitly investigate causal effects involving personality, as well as a pre-conference workshop for early career researchers at the European Conference on Personality (ECP - https://www.ecp20.com) in Madrid in July 2022.
